    "### Predict the TOTAL COMPENSATION for this year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data file provided is a salary survey for tech workers in Europe. We want to predict the total amount of compensation they bring in each year, based off of the details of their work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes that will be important:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The total compensation will need to be constructed, there is a column for salary, \"Yearly brutto salary (without bonus and stocks) in EUR\", as well as a column for bonus compensation, \"Yearly bonus + stocks in EUR\". \n",
    "    <li>Some categorical variables will need some work, and there isn't generally an exact answer. The main concern is things with categories that have a bunch of values with a very small count. For example, if there is only 1 person in City X, then that value likely needs to be addressed. We don't want it encoded into a new column of one 1 and thousands of 0s. \n",
    "    <li>There is an article exploring some of the data here: https://www.asdcode.de/2021/01/it-salary-survey-december-2020.html\n",
    "    <li>Imputation and a bit of data manipulation will be required. \n",
    "    <li>Use any regression method you'd like. Some ones are closely related to what we've done, you may want to look at them, e.g. ExtraTreesRegressor. \n",
    "    <li>Initial accurracy, and potentially final accuracy, may not be great. When I made a plain model will little optimization the errors were large and the R2 was low. There is lots of room for optimization. \n",
    "    <li>Research challenge - try some work on the target, look into TransformedTargetRegressor and see if that helps. Recall in stats when we had skewed distributions... Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't. \n",
    "    <li>EDA and data prep are up to you - you'll probably need to do a little exploring to figure out what cleanup is needed. When I did it, I did things kind of iteratively when I did it. For example, look at the value counts, figure out how to treat the different categories, clean something up, look at the results, potentially repeat if needed. After you figure out what needs to be done, you may be able to take some of those steps and incorporate them into a pipeline to be cleaner....\n",
    "    <li><b>CRITICAL - Please make sure you publish it after having run it, all the output should be showing.</b>\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll need to build code to produce the predictions. In particular, there's a few things that'll be marked:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Please add a \"presentation version\" at the bottom, where you show what you did, and the results. Basically, you start with the original data, you do some work to figure out what's needed, you try a few models and select the best. At the bottom, put what <i>you actually settled on</i>, i.e. after all the figuring and exploring, here's the code that goes from raw data to final results, and here's what the results were. I should be able to read this part and understand what you did clearly:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> Please make a pipeline that does the prep work - you may need some exploration or several trials before settling on what exactly to use, that's normal. Once you've settled, build that into a pipeline so it's clear and repeatable.\n",
    "        <li> What you settled on for data cleaning, along with what prompted it. \n",
    "        <li> Feature Selection - Please identify what you did for feature selection. No need for a long explaination, something along the lines of \"I did X, and the result was that 4 features were removed\". Try at least 2 things. \n",
    "        <li> Model selection - between selecting a model style and tuning it with hyperparameters, what did you test and what won?\n",
    "        <li> Overall, how good was your model and what things may make sense to try to do even better? \n",
    "        <li> If you could use titles/bullet points I'd really appreciate it. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <li>Grade Breakdown:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> Code is readable, there are comments: 20%\n",
    "        <li> Explaination as defined above: 60% (20% each point)\n",
    "        <li> Accuracy: 20% As compared to everyone else. This will be generously graded, I won't be surprised if overall accuracy is low for most people. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The biggest challenge here is translating the data into something useful and clean. This will probably require a bit of exploration, examining the data, thinking about what it means, trying something, then making a model to see what the results are. In particular, think about what value some of the less clean bits of data my hold - binning/grouping, numerical transformations, outlier removal, etc... are all likely to be useful somewhere. You almost certainly need to look at it column by column and make a decision, I'll apologize up front, it isn't the most fun process in the world. There is not one specific correct answer.</b>"

    "After constructing the target, both salary and bonus columns were removed from the feature set to prevent the model from directly using components of the target.\n",

    "Converted numeric columns safely:\n",
    "Salary, bonus, and experience columns were initially stored as object types due to inconsistent survey input. These were converted to numeric using coercion, and invalid entries were treated as missing values.\n",

    "### Here's my Tuning/Feature Selection Steps\n",
    "Ridge Regression was used as a baseline linear model, but after removing target leakage it performed poorly (negative R2), indicating that the relationship is not purely linear. Lasso was tested with multiple alpha values to perform embedded feature selection, but performance did not improve and convergence warnings occurred due to the high-dimensional sparse feature space after one-hot encoding. This suggested that linear shrinkage methods were not well suited for this dataset. Tree-based models were then tested because they handle non-linear relationships and interactions effectively. Among these, RandomForest performed best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two feature selection approaches were applied. First, Lasso was used as an embedded selection method to shrink weak coefficients, but it did not improve predictive performance. Second, permutation importance was applied to the tuned RandomForest model to identify influential predictors. The most impactful features included City (e.g., Berlin), Position (e.g., Backend Developer), and experience-related variables, confirming that location and experience were key drivers of compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RandomForest model was tuned using GridSearchCV over n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf, and max_features. Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved performance compared to the baseline RandomForest model. As part of the research challenge, a log-transformed target was tested using TransformedTargetRegressor to address skewness. Although cross-validation metrics slightly improved, the transformed model did not outperform the tuned RandomForest on the test set, so the original-scale RandomForest was selected as the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's my Model's Performance\n",
    "The tuned RandomForest clearly outperformed the linear models, demonstrating that compensation depends on non-linear interactions among features such as City, Position, and experience. Diagnostic plots showed that predictions follow the general upward trend of actual compensation, though the model tends to underestimate very high salaries. Residuals were centered near zero but exhibited a right tail, confirming difficulty in modeling extreme compensation values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's my Final Conclusion on What Worked Best\n",
    "The tuned RandomForest model performed best overall and was selected as the final model. It achieved the lowest test RMSE and the highest test R2 among all models evaluated. This indicates that tree-based methods are better suited for this dataset than linear models, likely because compensation depends on non-linear relationships and interactions between categorical and numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models such as Ridge and Lasso struggled after removing target leakage, suggesting that compensation cannot be well approximated by a simple linear combination of features. The log-transformed target slightly improved cross-validation metrics but did not outperform the tuned RandomForest on the test set, so it was not selected as the final model."
